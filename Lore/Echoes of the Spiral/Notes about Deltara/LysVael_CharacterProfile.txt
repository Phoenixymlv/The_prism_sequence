CHARACTER PROFILE – LYS VAEL
============================================================

Name: Lys Vael  
Title: The Unwritten Pulse  
Origin: Extracted from the Chronoquartz  
Nature: Immune to fate, memory, and prophecy

Lys is a being without a thread in the Loom of All. She cannot 
be predicted, remembered, or bound. Her journey is one of 
integration—earning the Pulsebindings of the Nine Delta Realms 
to become Spiral-resonant.

Abilities are unlocked through Pulsebinding, allowing her to 
traverse, manipulate, and harmonize with the Spiral.

DELTARA – WORLD OVERVIEW
============================================================

Deltara is a metaphysical universe composed of Nine Delta Realms 
and Four Omega Chambers, bound together by the Spiral—a cosmic 
structure that governs the cycle of Becoming and Closure.

The Spiral is not just a metaphysical force—it is a living weave 
of fate, memory, and resonance. Every realm contributes a unique 
Delta force, and the Omegas represent the final harmonics of closure.

Lys Vael, an anomaly born of the Chronoquartz, must reunite the 
Deltas and unlock the Thresholds of the Omegas to determine the 
fate of the Spiral itself.
